        question: "How do I find the best credit card?",
        answer: `When deciding on your next or first card, this is heavily dependent on what you’re looking for, along with what requirements you meet. Here is a list of a few things to consider:
• Your financial goals: What are you hoping to get out of your next card? Are you trying to build credit for the first time? Are you trying to get maximum cash back? Are you looking to travel using points and rewards? In our Find-A-Card platform, you can easily see the main purpose and value a card provides.
• Your credit history: Do you have a strong credit history? Do you have multiple credit cards? Is this your first credit card? By looking at your credit history or your credit score, this can be a big factor in your likelihood of getting approved for a credit card. Before applying for a credit card, check your credit and utilization history and cross compare it to the card requirements.
• Location: Dependent on your country’s credit policies, there will be different requirements and histories that banks will look at. For some countries, credit score and utilization rate is important to consider before applying. Check your country’s specific requirements to best understand how to make your credit card application in the best shape possible.
• Fees & Rates: Before applying for a credit card, consider the card’s costs and rates. Typically, new credit card users look for cards that have no annual fee or low interest rates.`

        question: "Are the credit cards displayed in this portal all the cards available in the market?",
        answer: "No, the Find-A-Card portal does not display all the cards in the market nor all the Mastercard cards in the market. Mastercard displays cards provided by and verified by partnered issuers who select the cards they want displayed on the portal."

        question: "What are the key differences between debit, credit and other types of cards?",
        answer: `• Credit Cards: These allow you to borrow money from the issuing bank up to a set limit, which you must repay with interest if not paid off each month. They can help build credit if used responsibly.
• Debit Cards: Linked directly to your bank account, debit cards use your own funds for transactions. They offer less financial risk since you cannot spend more than your account balance, but they don't help in building credit.
• Prepaid Cards: Similar to debit cards, prepaid cards involve spending money you load onto them in advance. Unlike debit cards, they are not linked to a bank account and often come with various fees (i.e., top-up fees).
• Gift Cards: These are typically loaded with a specific amount of money and can be either single-use (closed loop, valid only at specific retailers) or reusable (open loop, valid anywhere the card's network, like Mastercard, is accepted). Gift cards don't affect your credit and cannot be reloaded once the balance reaches zero.`

        question: "What are cashback card deals?",
        answer: "Cashback card deals are credit or debit cards that offer a cashback reward program. When you make purchases using a cashback card, you can earn a percentage of the amount spent as cashback. This cashback can be redeemed or used to offset future purchases, effectively giving you a discount on your spending."

        question: "Once I find the best matching card, what is the card application process like?",
        answer: `It's important to note that the credit card application process may vary slightly depending on the issuer and the specific card you are applying for. It's always recommended to carefully read the terms and conditions and understand the fees, interest rates, and any other relevant information before applying for a credit card. Most common card application steps include:
• Complete the Application Process: when redirected to the Card Issuer’s website, complete the card application form accurately and provide all the required information. This includes personal details, employment information, financial information, and contact details. Once you have filled out the application form, submit it to the credit card issuer. This can usually be done online through the issuer's website or by visiting a branch office.
• Verification and Approval: The credit card issuer will review your application and may verify the information provided. They will assess your creditworthiness based on factors such as credit history, income, and existing debts. If approved, you will receive a notification regarding the status of your application. Your approval confirmation or results can come in as quickly as instantly after completion or as long as a few weeks depending on the issuer’s process and your application.`
